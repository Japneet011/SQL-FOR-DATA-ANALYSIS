# SQL-FOR-DATA-ANALYSIS
This is my sql project where, I have used sql for a datset of a transport retailer which contains 7+ relational tables. I have used sql for finding key aspects of a business like profit share, revenue %, payment structure, customer analysis, vendor behaviour, month on month growth etc. Using joins, ctes, stored routines, views, subqueires, windows functions etc
